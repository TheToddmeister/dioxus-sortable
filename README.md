# Sortable tables for Dioxus

Notes / TODO:
- Interface: sorter.sort mimics slice::sort
- Like children is special, children_props would be good to pass to Th
- Being able to use sorter.Th() in rsx rather switching to rust would be good.
- Being able to declare use_sorter and use_sorter_with inside `impl Sorter` makes more sense
- Need a builder pattern too?
- Revisit IncreasingOrDecreasing naming
- NullHandling should be per field

# Development ideas

- Add a Table rsx component.
- Add a derive(Sortable) on T struct.
- Consider making SortBy an opaque trait covered by SortBy::* builders.
- Consider a default impl of Sortable that returns increasing_or_decreasing.
- Consider minimising Sortable in the docs and offering it as a way to customise further.
